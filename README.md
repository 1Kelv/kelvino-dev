# KelvinO.dev – Personal Portfolio 💼

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. This single-page application showcases my background, development experience, and key projects.

## 🔥 Purpose

While on holiday, I wanted to do something productive,  so I decided to build this portfolio from scratch. I initially implemented Tailwind CSS but faced challenges integrating dark mode across components, which led me to switch to **vanilla CSS** after days of debugging. This version now includes:

- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Smooth scrolling with `scrollIntoView`
- Subtle animations using **Framer Motion**
- Working contact form (via Netlify Forms)
- Live links to my projects and social platforms

- **AgileFlow** – A task/sprint manager with predictive AI and Supabase backend.
- **Banana Game 🍌** – A JavaScript puzzle game with real-time login and API challenges.
